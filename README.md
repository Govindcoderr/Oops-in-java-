# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are fundamental to modern software development. The core concepts include **classes and objects**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**. These principles help structure code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

### ðŸ“¦ Classes and Objects
- A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Objects** are instances of a class, representing real-world entities with specific properties and behaviors.

### ðŸ”’ Encapsulation
- Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a single unit (class).
- Restricts direct access to some components of an object.
- Promotes data hiding and security.

### ðŸ§¬ Inheritance
- Allows a class (subclass or derived class) to **inherit** properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).
- Encourages code reuse and establishes an **"is-a"** relationship.

### ðŸŒ€ Polymorphism
- Means "**many forms**".
- Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a **common superclass**.
- Supports method overloading and method overriding for flexibility and adaptability.

### ðŸ§Š Abstraction
- Exposes only the **essential** features of an object.
- Hides **unnecessary** internal details.
- Simplifies complexity and improves code usability.

## ðŸ§© Additional OOP Relationships

- **Association**: A general relationship between two classes.
- **Aggregation**: A special form of association where the child can exist independently of the parent.
- **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation where the child cannot exist without the parent.

These principles form the foundation of object-oriented design and are widely used in programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and C#.
